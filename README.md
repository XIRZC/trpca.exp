# Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis with Convex Optimization 

This is a repository of simple TRPCA experiments including image denoising and video background modeling, and most of codes are copied from [Lu Canyi's TRPCA Github Repo](https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-Robust-Principal-Component-Analysis-TRPCA) with some adaptions.

## Usage

Open MATLAB and select the subfolder `./trpca` as root workspace, and run `./trpca/rgb_image_denoising_task.m`, `./trpca/video_background_modeling_task.m` for two applications, respectively.

And then you would see the logs printed on MATLAB command pane, and know where the visualization results are saved to.

## Applications

There are mainly two TRPCA applications leveraged in this repo:
- RGB image denoising
- RGB video background modeling
