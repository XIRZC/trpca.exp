# Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis with Convex Optimization 

This is a repository of simple TRPCA experiments including image denoising, video background modeling and multi-dimensional data analysis and most of codes are copied from [Lu Canyi's TRPCA Github Repo](https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-Robust-Principal-Component-Analysis-TRPCA) with some adaptions.

## Usage

Use MATLAB open the subfolder `./trpca`, and run `./trpca/rgb_image_denoising_task.m`, `./trpca/video_background_modeling_task.m` and `./trpca/timeseries_tabular_data_mining_task.m` for three applications, respectively.

## Applications

There are mainly three TRPCA applications leveraged in this repo:
- RGB image denoising
- RGB video background modeling
- multi-dimensional data analysis.
